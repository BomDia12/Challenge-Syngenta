Nearly empty javascript project with a failing test!
===
**DO NOT change the function's name (getCheapestHotel), changing it implies in disqualification.** 

To install the required modules:

```
$ yarn install
```

To run the (failing) test:

```
$ yarn test
```
**After implementing your solution, it should pass the unit tests available.**
